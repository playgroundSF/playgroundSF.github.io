## Principles

- Timely, not noisy.
  Deliver messages at the right time. Not every interaction requires messaging to go with it.
- Informative, not verbose.
  Say what’s necessary and not much more.
- Actionable, not static.
  Enable shortcuts for relevant actions to improve efficiency.
- Cross device, not duplicative.
  When appropriate, alert users on all their devices, but clear the messaging once user has read it.

## Types

At a high-level, messaging types can be categorized by the nature of user interaction:

- System messaging
  alerts the user of important system-related issues or status. It’s initiated by the system and it’s not a result of the user’s actions.
  e.g. System maintenance coming up this weekend.
- Engagement messaging
  nudges the user to enter or update data in the system. It can be initiated by either the system or another user.
  e.g. No activity on Opportunity x in the past 30 days. Create a task or schedule an event.
- Access messaging
  appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc. etc.
  e.g. Lead x isn’t available.
- Feedback messaging
  is the application’s response when the user is interacting with it. The majority of create, read, update, delete (CRUD) actions will result in feedback messaging.
  e.g. Account x was created.
